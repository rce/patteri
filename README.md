# Patteri

This is a crappy radiator to radiate the status of Github Actions
for a single project on our Samsung Smart TV. It runs completely on
the browser and is just vanilla JavaScript without dependencies except
some polyfills because I want to `flatMap` and such.

All kinds of pull reqs are welcome. Just don't add any dependencies.

One version is being hosted at http://yareeh.github.io/patteri/ but you can also host
it locally running `yarn serve`.
